    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We build a second Agent (Pandas) in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We used another  Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 10**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

       "1. **Increased Severity of Illness**: Obesity is recognized as a significant risk factor for severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Studies indicate that individuals with obesity have a **3.40-fold increased odds** of developing severe COVID-19 compared to those with normal weight. This risk is even higher for obese men, who have a **5.66-fold increased odds** of severe disease [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Prevalence in Critical Care**: Data from the UK shows that approximately **72% of patients in critical care** units for COVID-19 were either overweight or obese. This highlights the substantial impact of obesity on the severity of COVID-19-related complications [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22844).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Cardiac Complications**: Obese patients are more likely to experience cardiac complications, which are closely associated with in-hospital mortality. This includes conditions such as myocarditis and heart failure [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Biological Mechanisms**: The adipose tissue in obese individuals may act as a reservoir for the virus, potentially leading to increased viral shedding and immune activation, which can exacerbate the severity of the disease [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22843).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Effects of COVID-19 on the Elderly\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Higher Mortality Risk**: Older adults are at a significantly higher risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. For instance, the mortality risk is **3.6% for those in their 60s**, escalating to **8.0% for those in their 70s** and **14.8% for those over 80** [[5]](https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15274).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Hospitalization Rates**: In Spain, **68% of all COVID-19 hospitalizations** were among individuals over 60 years of age, indicating a clear trend of increased incidence and severity in older populations [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.004).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Clinical Characteristics**: Elderly patients tend to have more severe clinical characteristics compared to younger patients, including a higher proportion of multiple lobe involvement in pneumonia and lower lymphocyte counts [[7]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.005).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Social Isolation Recommendations**: Due to their vulnerability, health authorities recommend that older adults practice social isolation to minimize their risk of exposure to the virus [[5]](https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15274).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "Both obese individuals and the elderly are at heightened risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. Obesity significantly increases the odds of severe disease and complications, while older adults face higher mortality rates and more severe clinical presentations. Public health measures, including social isolation for the elderly and careful management of obese patients, are critical in mitigating these risks."

       "**bing**: **CLP** stands for **Classification, Labelling and Packaging**. It is a regulation in the European Union (EU) that aims to ensure the safe handling of chemicals by providing clear information about their hazards. Here are the key points about CLP:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Overview of CLP\n",
       "- **Regulation Basis**: The CLP Regulation (EC No 1272/2008) is based on the United Nations’ Globally Harmonised System (GHS).\n",
       "- **Purpose**: Its main goal is to protect human health and the environment by ensuring that the hazards of chemicals are clearly communicated to workers and consumers.\n",
       "- **Scope**: It applies to all industrial sectors and requires manufacturers, importers, or downstream users to classify, label, and package hazardous chemicals appropriately before they are placed on the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Components\n",
       "1. **Hazard Classification**: Determines whether a substance or mixture is hazardous based on specific criteria. This classification is the starting point for hazard communication.\n",
       "2. **Labeling Requirements**: Includes the use of pictograms, signal words, and standard statements for hazard, prevention, response, storage, and disposal.\n",
       "3. **Packaging Standards**: Sets general standards to ensure the safe supply of hazardous substances and mixtures.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Additional Processes\n",
       "- **Harmonised Classification and Labelling (CLH)**: Ensures consistent classification and labelling across the EU.\n",
       "- **C&L Inventory**: Manufacturers and importers must submit classification and labelling information to a central inventory held by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).\n",
       "- **Poison Centres**: Information is submitted to designated bodies for emergency health responses, including a unique formula identifier (UFI) for mixtures.\n",
       "\n",
       "For more detailed information, you can refer to the official ECHA page on CLP [here](https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/clp/understanding-clp) [[1]](https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/clp/understanding-clp)."

       "   - As Pete becomes more focused on his fighting, Monica realizes that their priorities and lifestyles are diverging. She wants a more stable and secure relationship, while Pete is consumed by his new passion.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **The Final Straw:**\n",
       "   - The breakup culminates in a scene where Monica attends one of Pete's fights. After witnessing the brutality of the sport and seeing Pete get hurt, she decides that she cannot support his choice to pursue this dangerous career.\n",

       "\n",
       "### Importance of Saying No\n",
       "1. **Empowerment**: Teaching children to say \"no\" helps them feel safe and empowered, allowing them to express their feelings and assert their boundaries.\n",
       "2. **Avoiding Compliance Issues**: Children who are not allowed to say \"no\" may struggle to set boundaries in their relationships as adults, leading to feelings of being overwhelmed or taken advantage of.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Strategies for Saying No\n",
       "1. **Modeling Behavior**: Demonstrate how to say \"no\" respectfully and assertively. This teaches children that it's okay to express their own limits.\n",
       "2. **Encouraging Independence**: Allow children to make choices and express their preferences. For example, if a child does not want to hug a relative, support that decision rather than forcing affection.\n",
       "3. **Staying Connected**: When a child says \"no,\" remain emotionally connected and do not withdraw affection. This reinforces that their feelings are valid and respected.\n",
       "4. **Setting Clear Limits**: Establish clear and consistent boundaries. Avoid giving in to tantrums or emotional outbursts, which teaches children that limits are important.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "Saying \"no\" is essential for teaching children about boundaries and self-respect. By modeling appropriate behavior, encouraging independence, and maintaining emotional connections, you can help your children develop healthy boundaries that will benefit them throughout their lives.\n",
       "\n",
